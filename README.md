**DESCRIPTION**
    ***Consultation***
    1- Read the min and the max in order to apply the insert function for champs/groupes/articles
    2- If the operation is adding new lines, then we check if the line exists before adding it
    3- If the operation is deleting lines, then we delete
    4- After having everything done, we determine ourselves the min and the max of the current table
    5- We use that to fetch data
    6- Conditionally, we either have a delete button with values of min and max or add buttons
